# MATRIX-Unity-Airplane-App
Control an airplane, inside a unity game, with the MATRIX gyroscope. This MATRIX Core branch has moved away from MOS for improved performance and maintainability for when this demo is showcased in areas with spotty WiFi.

#First Time Setup
```cd unityMatrixCore```
```npm install```

#How To Start
This app comes with a mac Desktop app, but there is a webpage version of the game accessed in YOUR-PI-IP:3001. Once you launch the game, you will need to enter YOUR-PI-IP:3000.

```cd unityMATRIXCore```
``` node app```
